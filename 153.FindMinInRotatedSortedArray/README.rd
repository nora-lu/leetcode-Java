Looking at subarray with index [start,end]. We can find out that if the first member is less than the last member, there's no rotation in the array. So we could directly return the first element in this subarray.

If the first element is larger than the last one, then we compute the element in the middle, and compare it with the first element. If value of the element in the middle is larger than the first element, we know the rotation is at the second half of this array. Else, it is in the first half in the array.

One place worth noticing is the termination conditions. Whenever our window has only one element, its value is the answer. When our window has two elements, and the first element is larger than the second one, the second element is our answer. This case falls into the num[mid]>=num[start] condition in the code below. (given that there is no duplicates in the array)
